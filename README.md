# Task One

A Python script for data processing and analysis, designed for seamless integration into workflows or automation pipelines. This project was originally developed in a Jupyter Notebook and then converted into a standalone Python script (`task_one.py`).

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Import data from multiple sources like databases, files, or APIs.
- **Data Processing**: Transform and analyze data using modular functions.
- **Ease of Use**: Structured for scalability and reusability.

## Requirements

Ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `psycopg2`
  - `sqlalchemy`
  - `python-dotenv`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsega19/TellCo-Telecom-Analytics-Dashboard.git
   cd task_one
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment variables:

   ```
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_PORT=your_database_port
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `task_one.py` script and customize it as needed for your data sources and processing tasks.

2. Execute the script:

   ```bash
   python task_one.py
   ```

3. For database operations, ensure your database server is running and accessible.
